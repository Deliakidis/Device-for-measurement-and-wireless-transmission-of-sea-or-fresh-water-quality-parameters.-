This repository provides the source code for my project 
The objective of this project is to measure various parameters of seawater quality, wirelessly transmit the data, and make it accessible on the internet. The parameters under consideration include temperature, pH, and turbidity, with the potential for incorporating additional sensors. The project is built around the atmega328p and the esp32 microcontrollers and comprises two primary components. The first component houses the sensor circuit, which can be sealed in a container below sea level for extended periods. To continually track the circuit's location, a GPS module has been integrated to display precise geographical coordinates on a map.
The sensor readings are transmitted wirelessly to the second circuit, situated on land, which collects, graphically represents, and publishes the acquired data on a web page. This system's significance lies in its ability to monitor these parameters, assess changes in water quality, and promptly identify potential issues such as eutrophication, pollution, and more. Additionally, it's worth noting that this device can be employed for analogous research in various aquatic environments, including rivers and lakes.
